ToDo List
TODo App
I have implemented Recycler view with card view.Main activity has 2 menu items ADD and goto finished activity.
Add item menu pops up a dialog box where we enter the title,description and date of the event.
Validation for minimum 5 characters in the title,description and date not selected is performed.
On item added a page appears prompting the successful addition to the list.
The recycler view is sorted in order of date.
When due date is reached the heading will appear in red.
On single click of an event on the Recyclerlist a dialog box appears with the information of the event loaded in it and changes updated.
on Long click of an event the item is marked finished and will go to the finished activity.Colour of cardview becomes green prompting finish.
In finished activity 2 menu buttons
  a)Delete all finished events(added by me)
  b)Back to main
On clicking delete all icon a delete dialog box appears with yes/no option.If yes is selected all items in finished list are deleted.
On long press of an event in the finished list the item is automatically deleted from the list and the same is reflected in the finished list.
